Welcome to the Asteroidea framework homepage.  You are probabbly wondering what Asteroidea is - well the answer is - whatever you want! Asteroidea is a PHP5.5 Big Data Processing Framework for Analog and Digital Data Sources.  We also offer many types of storage engines and methods of handling and working with your distributed data sets.  This framework is also built to be used with embedded systems and automation systems.  It can be used as a bridging mechanism for applications and services to rapidly enrish and extend data processing capabilities.

It is currently being built with a distributed architecture with storage engines for mongoDB, Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and PDO support.  The intentions of this framework are to build scalable SaaS and PaaS data platforms that are responsive, quick, and easily extended.  Many popular javascript frameworks have also been incldued to streamline UI development for your custom applications.

What seperates this framework from other frameworks and particularly frameworks using the MVC pattern is that it is aimed at handling data instead of content.  Asteroidea is built on bridging, analyzing, processing, and capturing data as our core foundations.  Asteroidea is not for quickly generating user interfaces and simple CRUD applications like most modern frameworks have seem to move towards.

I am planning on adding additional features and functionality as time moves on.  If you would like to contribute or fork Asteroidea this is encouraged!
